## Label Assembly

Notebooks related to assembly of reference labels are stored in the `05-Assembly/` subdirectory.

To assemble final labels, we retrieve the cluster annotations generated by our domain experts, assign these to individual cell barcodes based on our clustering analysis, and assemble the entire set of labels for all of the cell barcodes in our reference.

#### Label assignment to barcodes

- **17-Python_assign_B_cells.ipynb**  
Assignment of annotations to B cell barcodes  
- **18-Python_assign_Myeloid_cells.ipynb**  
Assignment of annotations to Myeloid cell barcodes
- **19-Python_assign_NK_cells.ipynb**  
Assignment of annotations to NK cell barcodes  
- **20-Python_assign_Other_cells.ipynb**  
Assignment of annotations to Other barcodes  
- **21-Python_assign_T_cells.ipynb**  
Assignment of annotations to T cell barcodes  

### Dataset assembly

 - **22-Python_assemble_final_labels.ipynb**  
 Assemble all barcode labels across all classes to generate a final set of labels.

- **23-Python_generate_clea_version.ipynb**  
Add labeling results to scRNA-seq data (.h5ad files) and filter non-labeled cells (low quality, doublets) to generate the final, clean dataset.

### Generate UMAP projections for subsets of cells

- **24-Python_clean_B_cell_projections.ipynb**  
UMAP projection of all B and Plasma cell types  
- **25-Python_clean_Myeloid_cell_projections.ipynb**  
UMAP projection of all Myeloid cell types  
- **26-Python_clean_NK_cell_projections.ipynb**  
UMAP projection of all NK cell types  
- **27-Python_clean_Other_cell_projections.ipynb**  
UMAP projection of all Other cell types  
- **28-Python_clean_T_cell_projections.ipynb**  
UMAP projection of all T cell types  

### Full dataset normalization and UMAP

- **29-Python_clean_all_genes_normalized.ipynb**  
Renormalize all genes for use in analyses in the full dataset  
- **30-Python_clean_all_projections.ipynb**  
UMAP projection of all cells  
- **30a-Python_additional_vis_with_all_genes.ipynb**  
Renormalize all genes for the dataset post UMAP projection (used for visualization tools)
