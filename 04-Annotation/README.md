## Expert Annotation

Notebooks related to annotations of clustered cells are stored in the `04-Annotation/` subdirectory.

Expert annotations are based on the clusters, markers, and visualizations generated in the subclustering notebooks, above.

Annotation itself was performed by collaborative groups of AIFI researchers to generate 3 levels of labels for each of the major cell classes.

The set of notebooks for annotations connect CSV files generated by domain experts that assign an identity to each Leiden cluster for these cell classes:

### 12-Python_B_cell_annotations.ipynb
Annotations for B cells and non-effector memory B cell subclusters.

### 13-Python_Myeloid_cell_annotations.ipynb
Annotations for Myeloid cells and their subclusters.

### 14-Python_NK_cell_annotations.ipynb
Annotations for NK cell types.

### 15-Python_Other_annotations.ipynb
Annotations for Platelets, Erythrocytes, and developmental progenitor populations.

### 16-Python_T_cell_annotations.ipynb
Annotations for T cells and their subclusters.
